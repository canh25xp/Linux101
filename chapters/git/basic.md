## All `git` subcommands

<!--
```sh
git help --all | awk '/^   [a-z0-9-]+/ {count++} END {print count}'
# 196
```

```sh
git help --all | awk '
/^Main Porcelain Commands/ {section="Porcelain"}
/^Ancillary Commands/ {section="Ancillary"}
/^   [a-z0-9-]+/ {count[section]++}
END {
  for (s in count) print s ":", count[s]
}'

# Porcelain: 45
# Ancillary: 151
```
-->

As of today (2026-01-18),
`git` has total of $196$ subcommands ($45$ Porcelain and $151$ Ancillary)

<!-- Porcelain: main commands-->
<!-- Ancillary: supporting commands-->

- Porcelain: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `pull`, `push`, ...
- Ancillary: `config`, `reflog`, `blame`, `prune`, ...

<!--
Just the main commands alone would take me all days to teach about it.
So my best advise is, just play around with it, clone some code, commit some files, revert some changes, ...
-->

## Destructive `git`

3 way to manipulate history: `reset`, `revert`, `checkout`

Like most git operation, All 3 of them can be **undo** by `reflog`

These commands can **NOT** be undo:

```sh
git reset --hard
git checkout foo.c
```

It will discard work tree changes (uncommitted files)

## Bad practices `git`

Bad practices and mistakes to avoid

---

### Force push

```sh
git push --force # Don't
git push --force-with-lease # Do
```

Don't do it only a shared branch / projects

---

### Commit unnecessary files

- Temporary files, Binary files, Build artifacts, ...
- Reproducible non text file:
  - Compiled object / binary files: `main.o`, `app.exe`
  - Generated docs: `main.pdf` &larr; `main.tex`, `slide.pdf` &larr; `slide.md`
  - Generated assets: `intro.gif` &larr; `intro.tape`
- Platform specific, machine specific file:
  - `/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/lib/security/cacerts`: Don't
  - `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts`: Do
